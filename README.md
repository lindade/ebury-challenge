This was a task given by Ebury to get some insight into the programming abilities of applicants.
I choose to build a HTML website and to use JavaScript to caculate and solve the given problem.


## The Problem
Your best friend has just opened a Twitter account and, to help make himself known, he has begun to follow random people. You don’t have a Twitter account but you want to help him by making sure every person he follows then also follows him back.
Initially, the account has 0 followers and every twitter account has a confidence level. An account with a Ci confidence level will wait until at least Ci other accounts are following your friend’s twitter account before also following your friend.  
For example, if Ci = 0, the account will immediately follow your friend back whereas a twitter account with Ci = 2 will only follow your friend once it has 2 followers.
You know the confidence level of every account your friend has begun to follow and you're prepared to ask some friends that have Twitter accounts to help. Each of these friends have different confidence levels but all can be Ci = 0, it does not matter.

What is the minimum number of friends that you need to ask for help to guarantee that all the accounts will follow your friend’s account back?  
The input of this problem will have the following format:  
< C(max) “Maximum Confidence Level in Account Owners”>  
< String of C(max) + 1 single digits >

The string of digits represents the number of people of each confidence level that your friend begins to follow, so the kth digit of this string (counting starting from 0) represents how many twitter accounts with confidence level k your friend has begun to follow.  
For example, the string “513” would mean that your friend began to follow 5 accounts with Ci = 0, 1 account with Ci = 1, and 3 accounts with Ci = 2, and the string “107” would mean that your friend began to follow 1 account with Ci = 0 and 7 accounts with Ci = 2 (and none with Ci = 1).
